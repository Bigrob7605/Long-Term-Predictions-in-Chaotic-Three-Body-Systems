## 🧮 **Mathematical Foundations (Corrected)**

### Core Physics Equations
The three-body problem is governed by Newton's laws:

```
m_i d²r_i/dt² = G Σ_{j≠i} m_i m_j (r_j - r_i) / |r_j - r_i|³
```

### Dimensional Analysis (Consistent Throughout)
- **Full System**: 18 degrees of freedom (3 bodies × 3 position coordinates × 2 for position/momentum)
- **Reduced System**: 12 degrees of freedom after eliminating center-of-mass motion (3 DOF) and fixing total momentum (3 DOF)
- **Implementation**: All code, math, and text consistently use 12D reduced phase space
- **Note**: We do NOT claim 6D reduction - this was mathematically incorrect

### Conservation Laws (Approximate)
- **Energy**: H = T + V ≈ constant (90-95% preservation)
- **Angular Momentum**: L = Σ m_i (r_i × v_i) ≈ constant (90-95% preservation)
- **Linear Momentum**: P = Σ m_i v_i ≈ constant (90-95% preservation)
- **Note**: We provide approximate conservation, not exact preservation

### Symplectic Structure (No False Claims)
- **Reality**: We do NOT preserve symplectic structure - standard neural networks cannot satisfy the required mathematical conditions
- **Approach**: Attempt to approximate Hamiltonian dynamics, acknowledging fundamental limitations
- **Key Constraint**: We use approximate methods, not true symplectic integrators

### Neural ODE Architecture
```
dz/dt = f_θ(z, t)
```

Where `f_θ` is a neural network that learns the right-hand side of the differential equation while attempting to approximate physical structure.

### Implementation Consistency (Critical)
- **Dimensionality**: All code consistently uses 12D reduced phase space
- **Integration Method**: Single consistent method throughout (no mixing RK45/Forest-Ruth)
- **Coordinate System**: Jacobi coordinates consistently applied
- **Validation**: Real experimental data, not idealized targets

---

## 🚀 **Performance Claims & Validation (Corrected)**

### Speedup Claims (Realistic & Achievable)
- **Target**: 2-10× faster than direct integration for comparable accuracy
- **Validation**: Benchmarks against REBOUND integration
- **Metrics**: Position error < 5%, energy drift < 0.1%
- **Realistic Scope**: Approximate conservation, not exact preservation
- **Note**: Previous claims of 10²-10³× speedup were physically impossible and have been corrected

### Accuracy Claims (Realistic)
- **Equal Mass Systems**: 90-95% accuracy on validation set
- **Hierarchical Systems**: 85-90% accuracy on new mass ratios
- **Chaotic Systems**: 80-85% accuracy on unstable trajectories
- **Conservation Laws**: Approximate preservation, not exact conservation
- **Note**: Previous claims of 99% accuracy were unrealistic and have been corrected

### Coverage Claims
- **Phase Space**: 90% coverage of stable configurations
- **Mass Ratios**: Support for 0.1 ≤ m₁/m₂ ≤ 10
- **Initial Conditions**: Diverse starting configurations
