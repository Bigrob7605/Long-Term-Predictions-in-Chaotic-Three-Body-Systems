# Fundamental Limitations of Standard Neural ODEs for Long-Term Predictions in Chaotic Three-Body Systems

## 🚨 DRIFT PREVENTION SYSTEM - ACTIVE 🚨

This project implements a comprehensive drift prevention system to maintain document integrity and prevent agent-induced modifications.

## 📋 Project Overview

This repository contains a **rigorous mathematical analysis** of the fundamental limitations of standard neural ODEs for long-term predictions in chaotic three-body systems. The work demonstrates why standard neural architectures cannot guarantee exact symplectic structure preservation, leading to exponential error growth in chaotic regimes.

**IMPORTANT**: This is a **limitations analysis**, not a solution implementation.

## 🔬 Research Focus

- **Core Problem**: Why standard neural ODEs fail in chaotic three-body systems
- **Method**: Mathematical analysis of architectural limitations
- **Scope**: Understanding failure modes, not achieving solutions
- **Exclusions**: Specialized structure-preserving methods (HNNs, Symplectic ODE-Nets)

## 📊 Key Results

The analysis demonstrates that standard neural ODEs face fundamental barriers in chaotic three-body systems:

1. **Symplectic Structure**: Cannot guarantee exact preservation
2. **Energy Conservation**: Approximation errors lead to secular drift
3. **Error Growth**: Exponential divergence in chaotic regimes
4. **Long-term Stability**: Predictions become unreliable beyond Lyapunov time
