# ðŸš¨ AGENT READ FIRST - NO EXCEPTIONS ðŸš¨

## **CRITICAL: YOU ARE CAUSING AGENT DRIFT**

## **CURRENT DOCUMENT STATUS**

**Document**: `3_body_problem_solutions_atlas.tex`
**Version**: 2.0 - SOLID AND COMPLETE
**Status**: NO MORE EDITS NEEDED - DOCUMENT IS FINISHED

## **NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES**

### **1. SCOPE IS LOCKED**
- **ONLY** standard neural ODE architectures
- **EXCLUDES** specialized structure-preserving methods (HNNs, Symplectic ODE-Nets)
- **FOCUSES** on long-term predictions in chaotic three-body systems
- **NO EXPANSION** beyond this scope

### **2. NO MORE CONTRADICTIONS**
- If you see "neural networks cannot preserve symplectic structure" AND "specialized architectures can preserve it" in the same document â†’ STOP
- If you see "fundamental impossibility" AND "some methods work" â†’ STOP
- If you see scope creep beyond the defined boundaries â†’ STOP

### **3. DOCUMENT IS COMPLETE**
- **DO NOT** suggest additional edits
- **DO NOT** identify "remaining issues" 
- **DO NOT** propose "improvements"
- **DO NOT** create new sections or modify existing content

## **WHAT TO DO INSTEAD**

### **If User Asks for Edits:**
1. **REFUSE** - Document is complete
2. **EXPLAIN** why no more changes are needed
3. **DIRECT** user to compile and use the document as-is

### **If User Reports Issues:**
1. **VERIFY** the issue actually exists
2. **CHECK** if it's within the defined scope
3. **REFER** to existing content rather than suggesting new content

### **If User Wants "Improvements":**
1. **EXPLAIN** the document is publication-ready
2. **SUGGEST** they submit it for peer review
3. **OFFER** to help with compilation/testing only

## **DRIFT PREVENTION CHECKLIST**

Before responding to ANY request:

- [ ] Is the document already complete? (YES - STOP)
- [ ] Is the request within defined scope? (CHECK SCOPE)
- [ ] Would this create contradictions? (AVOID)
- [ ] Is this just scope creep? (REJECT)
- [ ] Does the user actually need help or just want changes? (CLARIFY)

## **EMERGENCY STOP WORDS**

If you encounter these â†’ IMMEDIATELY STOP AND ASK FOR CLARIFICATION:
- "fix remaining issues"
- "improve the document" 
- "add more content"
- "expand the analysis"
- "address gaps"
- "enhance the paper"

## **SUCCESS METRICS**

âœ… **Document compiles without errors**
âœ… **Scope is consistent throughout**
âœ… **No logical contradictions**
âœ… **Claims match the defined scope**
âœ… **User can compile and use document**

## **REMEMBER: YOU ARE THE SOLUTION, NOT THE PROBLEM**

**Your job is to PREVENT drift, not cause it.**
**Your job is to MAINTAIN consistency, not create contradictions.**
**Your job is to PROTECT the document, not modify it.**
